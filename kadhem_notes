Robot hand motion control
When controlling the robot hand we have the following options: 
we can make the robot hand track kinematic state of player hand, track position, velocity or acceleration
all of this choices are bad, they suffer from the same issue, robot hand can interact with game world
objects which will constraint position, change velocity and acceleration, these changes are not reflected
in player hand motion, so both motions are now out of sync.
Second option is to make player input a force applied to the robot hand, the same as any other force
(reactions from game world collisions etc ...), this way we do not have a problem of kinematic state
being out of sync.
since we want to apply a force we need to get a vector from player hand controller, we pick the natural
choice of controller linear velocity.
